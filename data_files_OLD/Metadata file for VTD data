## Processing
L2 assigns each voter to a 2010 Census Block on their Voter File. 
L2 provided the RDH with a file that has each individual and their corresponding 2020 Census Block, dated 9/1/2021. 
The RDH joined the L2 Voter File to this 2020 Census Block assignment file. 
The RDH then aggregated the individual level Voter File to the Census Block level. 
The RDH created Census Block GEOIDs by concatenating the County FIPS, Census Tract, and Census Block codes for each individual. For some individuals, the GEOID created by concatenating the fields was not one that exists on the Census. The RDH removed these, as they are likely attributed to movers who were reassigned county but were not geocoded at their new address. This accounted for less than 1.5% of voters nationally. 
Processing was completed using SQL and Python. 
The RDH cannot certify the accuracy of any of the information contained within this file, or that the 2020 Blocks were the accurate geographies used for the elections contained in the file. 

## Additional Notes
The Block GEOID is composed of: 2-character State Fips + 3-Character County Fips + 6 character VTD ID + 4 character Block ID
