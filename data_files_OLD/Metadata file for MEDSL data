## Processing Steps
The RDH used Python's Pandas library to separate MEDSL's election data files by state for 2020. For more information on MEDSL's data processing, see MEDSL's Github repository for 2020 returns (https://github.com/MEDSL/2020-elections-official) and the codebook included on their Harvard Dataverse (https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/2020_precincts).

## Additional Notes
The source of MEDSL's data is typically each state's Secretary of State website or comparable elections division page on an official state website.
