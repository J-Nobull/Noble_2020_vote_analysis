# Noble-ANA630
ML project from Advanced Analysis 630

- Combine 3 files from the US Census, Pennsylvania Redisticting Commission, and MIT Election Data and Science Lab to create a single datafile for the 2020 November election in Pennsylvania.  
Pennsylvania was chosen because they had the tightest Democrat/Republican split (closest to 50%). 
It was impossible to acurately match voting districts to census blocks, so ended up with 67 clean records to analyze (county level) and results were unexpected.

Combine K-Means, Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering, 
Logistic Regression, Classification, Upsupervised Learning, and MANOVA to 
analyze dataset, identify key predictors, and evaluate their statistical significance.

This project will be expanded to analyze national demographics and confirm characteristics that strongly associate to party affiliation.
It combines two files from the U.S. Census and one from the MIT Election Data & Science Lab (MEDSL) to create a single datafile on the November 2020 general election.
